# README

This is an unofficial implementation of Gemini for command line.

## Installation

Include in fish shell:
```fish
source $CHATBOT_PATH/repl.sh
```

## Usage


Combine with `glow` to make a colorful REPL:

```fish
function wonszu
    bot "$argv[1]"   \
        --name=wonsz \
        --conversation=default | glow -w 60
end

function wonszu-repl
    repl-wrapper wonszu
end
```


Basic usage:
```bash
~/.c/chatbot on main ⨯ wonszu-repl

```

```scheme
    (define (memoize func)                                    
      (let ((cache (make-hash)))                              
        (lambda args                                          
          (if (hash-has-key? cache args)                      
              (hash-ref cache args)                           
              (let ((result (apply func args)))               
                (hash-set! cache args result)                 
                result)))))

## Directory Structure

Here's a breakdown of the main directories in this project:

* **`conv`**: Contains conversation files used by the chatbot.
* **`log`**: Stores log files generated by the chatbot.
* **`tmp`**: This directory is used for storing temporary files.
* **`LICENSE`**: This file contains the GNU GPLv3 license
  under which this project is distributed.

### Main Scripts
* **`chat.py`**: This is the main chat server that handles incoming messages and responses.
* **`bot.py`**: This is a command-line utility that you can use to interact with the chat server.
* **`repl.fish`**: A Read-Eval-Print Loop script that uses the `bot` command for continuous interaction with the chatbot.
* **`.pid`**: The files with the extension `.pid` are used for the process identifier of a running server.

## TODO

- [ ] make a list of available model types in arguments
- [ ] rewrite in c?
